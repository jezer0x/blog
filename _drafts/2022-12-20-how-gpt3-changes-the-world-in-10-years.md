# GPT3 15 Years Down The Line

## Looking Back - 2008

- Very limited processing power and storage, especially on handhelds
- Internet speed of a few kbps, and bandwidth usage limitations - using the internet was sluggish, expensive and not portable.
- Limited, expensive sensors -> cameras, mics, etc.

## What's Changed?

- Processing power and storage has gone exponential. I barely think about whether I have enough storage (though it's not free if we're talking terabytes of cloud storage) or enough memory (unless I'm doing something like trying to load up GPT3 on the laptop).
- Always connected, very little regard to network speed and bandwidth (though they still exist in lots of parts of the world).
- Sensors have not improved as fast but they've gotten cheap and software has been leveraged for enhancement/denoising/interpretation.

## Looking Ahead - 2037

- Storage is virtually free
  - Record everything, everywhere, all the time (and have it be searchable)
- Processing power has 1000x-ed
  - AI will be able to interpret and understand the world around us
- High bandwidth, low latency comms is a given anywhere in the world (though speed of light is still a fundamental constraint)
  - high quality telepresence is a thing because we get to 10ms latency
- Sensors are cheap and ubiquitous
- All the "grunt work" is gone. We don't have to do the boring stuff anymore. We can focus on the interesting stuff.
  - do we all go to a 4 hour work week? What to do with the rest of the 36 hours?
  - everyone becomes a "creator"? What does that mean?

## Dangers and Possible Mitigations

- Privacy and Surveillance. How do we protect ourselves from someone exploiting our data exhaust? The answer is probably not to not use the technology, but to use it in a way that protects our privacy.
  - Store the data locally, and only send it to the cloud when you need to. When do you need to? When you need to share it with someone else. Backups must be encrypted.
  - "Can't Be Evil" has to be a provable property for any centralized service that has access to your data.
- We leave more of the decision making to AI, and we lose control of our lives and become more dependent on it.
  - Make the AI explain its decisions. If it can't, then make your own decisions and let the AI learn from you.

## Things to Look Out For

- Nuclear Fusion
- Quantum Computing
- Brain Computer Interfaces
- Space Colonization
- Gene Editting

## What Might Get In They Way

- Fear of AI Singularity
- Catastrophy in the form of Natural Calamity / Man Made Weapons
